# Primary Objective

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisibly by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisibly by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your market value just went up.)
